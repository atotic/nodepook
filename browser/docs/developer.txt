TODO
Platform:
- recompute('propertyId'): force recompute of computed properties
- firebase-element-array: firebase-element that transforms data into array
- requestDatabase: get rid of it, use blank Firebase instead

Phase 1: Photobook organizer with sharing
- pages
  - show all pages
  - resize pages
  - add pages
  - add photos to pages
  - move photos between pages
  - move pages around
  - title pages

Done:
- book creation, sharing

Bugs:
- account email update does not update login email
  need email confirmation click before we change your login email

Phase 2: Photobook editor

## Firebase
rules.json defines our firebase schema
Main schema design principle: do not use hierarchy in security rules (no $userId/$photoId). Each object has an owner.
