Phase 1: Photobook organizer with sharing
- bug: no books on firefox/ipad
- sharing: share dialog ui
- if no email in db, notify user.
  $userId:
    notifications
    permanently displayed
  eventually: email new user, give them read access until they sign up
- display books shared with you
- pages
  - show all pages
  - resize pages
  - add pages
  - add photos to pages
  - move photos between pages
  - move pages around
  - title pages



Phase 2: Photobook editor

## Firebase
rules.json defines our firebase schema
Main schema design principle: do not use hierarchy in security rules (no $userId/$photoId). Each object has an owner.
